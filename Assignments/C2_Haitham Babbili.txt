\question according to Basic Principles of Wireless Networks lecture Which of the following is/are a Issues of a Multicarrier Modulation?

\begin{choices}

  \choice Requires reliable feedback channel and accurate channel estimation
	% MOTIVATION : Adaptive Modulation requires reliable feedback channel and accurate channel estimation

  \correctchoice Large bandwidth penalty 
	% MOTIVATION : Since the subcarriers canâ€™t have perfectly rectangular pulse shapes and still be time-limited.

  \correctchoice Expensive
	% MOTIVATION : Very high quality low pass filters will be required to maintain the orthogonality of the subcarriers at the receiver.

  \choice Total data rate is changed for N subcarriers with rate R/N.
	% MOTIVATION : Total data rate is unchanged for N subcarriers with rate R/N. 

\end{choices}
